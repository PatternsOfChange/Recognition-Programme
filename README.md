# Behavioral Change in Organizations: The Role of Recency in Recognition Programs
 
## Overview
This dissertation explores how **recency** affects the effectiveness of recognition programs in a private institution. The research examines whether exposure to recent communications about a recognition program improves the adoption of desired behaviors.

### Key Objectives:
- **Measure the impact** of recency on staff behavior within teams.
- **Test the hypothesis** that recency increases the effectiveness of recognition programs.
- **Quantitative Analysis** using randomized controlled trials to measure results.

---

## Methodology

- **Sample Size**: 211 software development teams.
- **Design**: Randomized controlled trial (RCT) with **treatment** and **control groups**.
- **Intervention**: Seven internal communications referencing the recognition program were sent to the **treatment group**. The **control group** received the same communications without the recency reference.

### Tools Used:
- **Quantitative Methods**: Regression analysis, hypothesis testing (p-values).
- **Software**: Stata for data analysis and result validation.

---

## Main Findings

- **Impact on Behavior**: The treatment group exhibited an **8.3% increase** in the adoption of behaviors promoted by the recognition program compared to the control group.
  
  > **Statistical Significance**: This effect was **marginally significant** (p=0.048).

- **Covariate Adjustment**: After controlling for relevant covariates, the effect was reduced to **8.04%** with **statistical significance** (p=0.05).

## Conclusion

This study supports the hypothesis that **recency can improve the effectiveness** of recognition programs in organizational settings, contributing to accelerated **behavioral change**.

### Key Contributions:
- **Practical Application**: These findings highlight how internal communication timing can improve staff engagement.
- **Behavioral Science Insight**: Recency enhances attention and salience in organizational contexts, leading to measurable behavioral shifts.
