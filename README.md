# How effective are recognition programmes? #

## Managers always wonder whether reccognition programmes are effective tools to trigger change ##


This research explores the effects of recency in improving the effectiveness of an existing recognition programme at a private institution. To create a recency effect, randomly selected staff members within 211 software development teams were exposed to seven internal communications with a reference to the recognition programme, whilst a control group was exposed to the same communications without such device. The experiment led to an 8.3% (p=0.048) marginally significant increase in the adoption of the behaviour promoted by the recognition programme. The effect is reduced to (8.04% p=0.05) after controlling for the covariates identified. The experiment supports the hypothesis that recency could be effective in improving the impact of recognition programmes, thus contributing to accelerate behavioural change in institutional contexts.
